## Jumping straight in
Although I have some experience with Javascript in Web Development (very, very limited), I was finally thoroughly introduced to (basic) Javascript from [Free Code Camp]:https://www.freecodecamp.com/. 

## The Language Itself 
Typically, when I jump into a new language I judge it by 2 things: 1. How many lines of code it takes to write "Hello World" and 2. how long it takes to compile and run (most important to me!), this includes having to download any dependencies. Hopping onto [JSFiddle]:https://jsfiddle.net/ , I simply put a one liner: `console.log("Hello World")` , hit F12 to open an in-browser console, then pressed Run, Javascript passed both of my "tests", and did so with flying colors! I do realize that many languages have their pros and cons, but at the end of the day,  I really want to see what the language can offer to me.
