## Overview

### The Problem
There is a disconnection between students, TA's and Professors. Many students need extra help with certain projects, homeworks or even studying for exams. The only solution to getting help outside of attending class or office hours is to simply just send an email. Many times this is insufficient enough to get the help that you need in a timely manner.

### The Solution
The proposed solution would be to create a web application similar to slack in the way that students can connect with their professors, TA's and even their peers. The web application would be built in Meteor and would allow students to not only instant message regarding help with certain assignments or simply just studying, but would allow students to have a discussion on certain class materials such as, powerpoint slides, diagrams, text-based notes etc. This includes commenting on such materials for students to engage in academic discussion regarding expected outcomes from the professor.


## Mockup
The user base is targeted towards UH Manoa students, professors, and TA's. They would have to first log in with their UH credentials and then they would be prompted with a screen showing all their classes. So for instance if the user was taking ICS 314, ICS 311, and PHYS 151L, they would be able to choose between those classes and be connected with their peers. Upon clicking a particular class, they will be able to see who is actively online, as well as a topic that is currently being discussed (has the most activity). The user will also be able to create a new topic of discussion and create chats (individual or group).

## Beyond the Basics
Professors can upload solutions to homeworks, as well as averages, stats among the class in an effort to allow students to get a basis of how they are doing in the class. This is especially useful for classes that typically grade on a curve. Students can also collaborate with their peers to create study groups with different discussions sorted by topics.
