## Introduction
This week I worked on an Angular project (Angular 4, to be exact) and although I've worked with Angular before, I learned a few new things this week that helped solidify my understanding of how to design and develop Angular applications. 

## Angular 
### What is Angular? 
Angular is an open source frontend framework built by google. There are two major versions of Angular that vastly differ from each other and the way you design and develop with it. I have only worked with Angular 2/4 (or also called just Angular, not AngularJS), so I will only speak of this version rather than AngularJS.

### Design
Angular is a component based frontend framework, meaning that each component has its own typescript, html, css and testing file. This organizes the project really well and makes it easy to maintain and make adjustments to in the future.

### Development
From my personal experience with Angular, its super easy to pick up, learn and make meaningful contributions towards. Angular can be paired up with Node Package Manager so it makes it easy to add significant features towards whatever you're making.

## Overall
Overall I think that Angular is great because you can rapidly develop something that can be easily maintained and picked up by new developers, whether they are new to the project or even Angular itself.
