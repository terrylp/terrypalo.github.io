## Intro
Changing up from what I usually talk about, where I usually find a piece of technology/paradigm that I use at work and analyze and elaborate about it, this week really felt just like an average week of development. It felt like an average week of development in the sense that I didn't really use any new technologies or practice any new paradigms of development. I wanted to talk about how the average week of development is for me, and what are my thoughts and goals for these kinds of weeks.

## The Average Week

### This Week
This week I did not do anything different from what I have been working on for the past few weeks, which has been creating an e2e test suite for an Angular + Sharepoint application. This is typically how an average week is for me in terms of workload and typical goals. It has been coming along pretty well, with minimal issues aside from one that I'll mention.

### Problems
I'm pretty sure problems are inevitable, no matter what project you are developing, but I think the important thing to do is to remember what you did to fix these problems so they don't occur again in the future. Although these problems are typically technical, they can also be social. For instance, this week I ran into a problem where I wrote e2e tests for the wrong part of an application but I didn't realize it until I completely finished writing all the tests. This would be more of a social problem rather than a technical in the sense that it could have easily been avoided if I asked more questions about my particular assignment.

### Solutions
Like I said earlier, you will proactively find solutions to these problems by learning from mistakes in the past. One of the key things I've learned from developing projects with teams ranging from small to large in size, is that communication between everyone (even on small teams) is super important. This week could have been a little easier on me if I simply asked more questions about the assignment I was given to create e2e tests for the application.

### Personal Goals
Typically, when I'm not necessarily learning anything new or especially when I've been working on the same project for a while I set aside personal goals for development to continue to strengthen my skill. This usually includes writing clean, and efficient code with clear documentation on how it works. Sometimes this can take a while so I try to set aside personal goals of writing *beautiful* code within a *reasonable* amount of time. I can easily get caught up trying to refactor code I have written in the past, by changing variable/function names that make more sense or even splitting logic to become more efficient.

## Other Thoughts
I feel like one thing I've noticed with good developers is that they consistently try to get better at what they do no matter what they are doing. That is what I aim for usually when I'm developing, even if its something very minor that I am working on. I think any opportunity to develop something is also an opportunity to get better at something.
