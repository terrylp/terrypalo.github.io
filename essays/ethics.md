## Introduction
Ethics is a very large and controversal subject, and especially when its in regards to the field of Software Engineering. Nowadays it is easy to take advantage of someone over the internet. whether it be spying on someone for your own benefit, harrassing someone, and especially engaging in fraudulent activities. 

## In the Context of Software Engineering
Ethics in the context of Software Engineering means not only protecting yourself, but also protecting others when it comes to developing software. To me, this also means providing beneficial solutions that solve problems in the world as well as preserve the idea of helping people out. 

### A Main Point: Privacy
Personally, I think privacy is one of the key issues that Software Engineers face when it comes to whether or not they should respect it. On one hand, some Software Engineers say that invading privacy can result in a better product to serve people. On the other hand, others say that invading privacy can result in a trend where it is socially acceptable to essentially spy on people. 

### A Major Case: Google Street View
In 2010, it was found that Google essentially gathered information from insecure wifi networks that Google Street View vehicles drove by. This included tons of personal data including SSIDâ€™s, device identifiers, medical and financial records, passwords and email content. 

Although it is impressive that they were able to do this, it doesnt mean that it is ethical at all. In my opinion this was unethical by all means. It was unethical because Google purposely took advantage of people who kept their Wifi networks unsecured. Generally when someone has an unsecure network, they are not very tech savvy, so one could go as far as to say that Google took advantage of those who are not very experienced with computers. 

This poses an issue, in my opinion, because this doesnt directly benefit those who had their privacy invaded, and really only benefited Google themselves. 

Kind of scary, really.

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, I think that Software Engineers should take an extra step to ask themselves whether doing something is ethical. The main reason for this is because there are so many things that Software is capable of doing and many of those things are unethical and only benefit one party.
