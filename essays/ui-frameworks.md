## Introduction
Even though, I have a little bit of experience with web development, I have always been a sort of "back end kind of guy" in the sense that I have more experience scraping data, or creating automated tools. Prior to learning Semantic UI, I did not have much experience with front end web development aside from basic HTML and CSS. When my professor for my Software Engineering class introduced Semantic UI, I thought to myself "how much more could a UI framework do for me instead of just learning and mastering HTML/CSS", and boy did I get an answer.


## What is it?
Semantic UI is a front end UI framework for developing responsive websites. Basically, it has pre written css stylesheets that can create borders, menus, grids and even pre-made icons for use on your own website. It is pretty handy!

### But I'm not good with CSS?

I think one of the most awesome things with Semantic UI is that you can easily create a decent website in less than an hour with very minimal amount of experience, and this also includes prior CSS experience. You simply just take a look at the docs for what you are looking for, copy some code and paste it in your html file and BOOM you have a brand new functionality implemented on your website. One of the things I really like about Semantic UI is that it is well documented and theres support for all kinds of issues online. As a result, this makes it easy to pickup and use. Another thing I really like is that many of the default settings including fonts, and color schemes for the framework are already very appealing so you can instantly upgrade a simple html/css website that you have made by hand.

### The Cons
Like many things, Semantic UI is easy to pick up and learn but it is difficult to master. I feel like there are many things you can do with Semantic UI that go well beyond implementing a very basic thing, but it takes time to learn the full potential of the framework. One of the assignments that my Professor gave us was to replica an already existing website. I decided to replicate a simple clothing designer website (http://www.undercoverism.com/) and it came out very similar to the actual website and I did not put much time into it (although I should have). Just imagine working on creating an exact replica for a website for a week, it would probably be an exact copy (kind of scary, really!).

## Overall
Overall, I think Semantic UI is a great UI framework to allow even people who do mostly back end development, like me, to develop a quick front end for a website. Although I do not have any prior experience with any other frameworks to compare this one with, I really enjoy the fact its much easier to use rather than spend hours on end trying to make a simple website by hand from CSS.
