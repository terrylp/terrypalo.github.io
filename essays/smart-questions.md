I am sure we have all faced a brick wall while working on a programming project and opened up a browser go to google and frantically type *HOW TO FIX X* and found EXACTLY what we were looking for on StackOverflow. But on the contrary, some of us have had those moments where we were *REALLY* stuck and either had to a) ask a friend or b) ask a stranger on StackOverflow.

Being honest, have you *actually* put effort into how you ask, or even what you ask a question about? The answer is probably no, but you probably should. 


## What you should NOT do
While browsing for the worst possible StackOverflow question I could find, I eventually found this. The original poster creates the post with a title "creating a shoppingcart in python." The first thing that comes to mind is "this sounds like something a teacher/professor would ask a student to accomplish." With that impression, I knew that his question was going to be really bad, and it was.

Here is a picture of the original posting
