## Interests
To me, Software Engineering is a very broad term and can be split into many aspects, such as development and even research. As a passionate computer science student, I genuinely enjoy learning new technologies that may further my skills. I currently partake in multiple projects including an Independent Video game, creating/designing a website, and webscraping. I also had jobs in the past that include some aspects of IT which included, building/repairing computers, and helping faculty and staff. I currently have in internship at a Web Development company here In Hawai'i and I genuinely enjoy it .For that, I'd say my skills and interests lie in Game Development, and Web Development. I enjoy working with other people, especially those who are just as interested and motivated as I am. 


## Goals
I would like to have a career in some sort of development, whether it be Software Development, Game Development or Web Development.  My overall personal goal is to find a career that helps and thoroughly benefits society as a result of my contributions. In the future, I hope to develop my communications skills as well as my skills with the development of different technologies. I would like to further develop my communications skills because communication is very important in all aspects of life.
