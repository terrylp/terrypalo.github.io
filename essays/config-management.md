A world without any sort of configuration management tools such as the combination of Git and GitHub would be a total mess. If you do not know what Git and GitHub are, then you probably should, especially if you are a developer! Before I knew about configuration management, I would have multiple folders to keep track of what version of the project I am working on. Although this *can* work decently for a single person working on a very *very* small project, it would be much better to just go ahead and use something like Git. The reason being, you can easily get lost by what you are doing, and what you are going to do. Eventually this would result in a very broken, and sloppily put-together project. *In other words,* Git is a life saver!

## What is it?
Git is a technology used to help developers keep track, organize, and maintain code, whether it be a small project or a very large project. My personal favorite thing about git is that it allows developers to collaborate and continuously develop at the same time without having to wait for one developer at a time to create something.

GitHub is a hosting platform for projects that use Git. There are others, like BitBucket, but GitHub is one of, if not, the most famous cloud based platforms for hosting Git projects. GitHub is well known in the open source world for allowing developers across the world to collaborate on projects. Octocat is GitHubs iconic mascot, and if you are a Computer Science major then I am sure you have probably seen it somewhere!

Some may ask, is GitHub popular because of Git? or is it the other way around, is Git popular because of GitHub?
In my personal opinion, I think Git has become popular because of GitHub. I'll explain why right now.

## The Cons with Git
Even though Git is a really great technology to help developers, I feel that git has *too* many commands, many of which are redundant and not consistent with each other. For example, `git pull` is simply just `git fetch` along with `git merge`. An example of Git not being consistent, and something that always bugs me, is when you want to pull the branch *origin master* you do `git pull origin master`, but if you want to check it out you do `git checkout origin/master`. That simple "/" confuses me every time. Before I enter the command I have to sit and think "Does this command use a slash?"

I think Git could have been designed a little better, the reason being not too much thought was put into the commands before implementing them. As a result, Git is not very new user friendly. It takes time learn Git and use it effectively, even I am still learning!

I think the reason Git has become popular is because of GitHubs popularity. Many developers nowadays, at least for myself and a few others, did not think "I want to learn Git, therefore I'm going to join GitHub", it seems to be the other way around because of the community behind GitHub.


## Overall
Git and GitHub are a lifesaver when it comes the process of developing projects, whether it be alone or with others. Even though some of the syntax and redundancies of Git annoy me at times, it is still an amazing technology to use.
