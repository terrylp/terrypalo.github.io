## Summary
Co-leader of a very diverse group of 8 people, including a story writer, graphic artists, and programmers.
I assist and contribute to level/mechanic design as well as C# scripting.

### Specifics
As co-leader,  I am responsible for assisting with weekly meeting times to establish goals for development. I also partake in level design, which includes: creating a well-flowing user experience, using Human Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts to allow for a better experience, creating interesting and fun mechanics for different zones. I also contribute to creating C# scripts to maintain a well-balanced and fun experience for the user. This includes different mechanics for user movement, user abilities as well as overall stability of the game. 

## The Game
The game is currently being built in the Unity3D engine for a 2D environment. BitBucket is being used as our main version control tool. The game includes a main character a long lasting plot, many zones to explore, and different interesting abilities to experience. 

A general goal for our game is to allow for a fun, well-flowing 2D experience experience that engages the player while not being boring, but not being tpo difficult (too quickly) at the same time.
