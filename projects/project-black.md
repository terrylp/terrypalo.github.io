## Summary
Co-leader of a very diverse group of 8 people, including a story writer, concept artists, and programmers.
I assist and contribute to level/mechanic design as well as C# scripting.

### Specifics
As co-leader,  I am responsible for assisting with weekly meeting times to establish goals for development and to ensure that these goals have been met in a timely manner as well. I also partake in level design, which includes: creating a well-flowing player experience by using Human Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts, as well as creating interesting and fun mechanics for different zones to interact with the player. I also contribute to creating C# scripts to maintain a well-balanced and fun experience for the player. This includes different mechanics for player movement, player abilities as well as overall stability of the game. 

## The Game
The game is currently being built in the Unity3D engine for a 2D environment. BitBucket is being used as our main version control tool. The game includes a main character a long lasting plot, many zones to explore, and different interesting abilities to experience. 

A general goal for our game is to allow for a fun, well-flowing 2D experience experience that engages the player while not being boring, but not being too difficult (too quickly) at the same time. 

For confidentiality of the game, I will not give specifics on the plot or mechanics, but here is some early concept artwork done by a one of our concept artists:
