## The game
The game was developed to be our final project in ICS 691. We decided to create a game that allowed the user, feeling the immersive effects of VR, to "destroy" the environment. The setting of the game was intended to feel very majestic and feel like no one has ever stepped foot there. This allowed for a more destructive feeling while you litter and destroy the environment.

There is a scoreboard to keep track of how much "damage" you have done and the more damage you do, the more things you unlock. The game will also give visual feedback of the damage by creating a sort of "smog" effect to show that the environment its not as majestic as it was before.

## My contribution
As leader of the group, I organized which feature a group member should work on, as well as meetings to further develop the game. I personally contributed by setting up the environment, which included designing the environment, retrieving all assets needed, and manually placing every object into the game. I was also responsible for creating various scripts to allow the user to feel more engaged, this included creating a script to allow all the functions of the "damaging tools" to be placed all in one controller.
