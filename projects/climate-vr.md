# The game
The game was developed to be our final project in ICS 691. We decided to create a game that allowed the user, feeling the immersive effects of VR, to "destroy" the environment. The setting of the game was intended to feel very majestic and feel like no one has ever stepped foot there. This allowed for a more destructive feeling while you litter and destroy the environment.
