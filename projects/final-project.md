summary: Final project for ICS 314 aimed at solving the problem of wasted money on meal plans at UH Manoa.
---
Manoa Dining Delivery was an idea that was initially just creating a food delivery service for students who dorm at UH Manoa, but was expanded to solve the issue of money being wasted weekly on junk food.

## The Problem Being Solved
For students who dorm at UH Manoa, it is mandatory to pay for a meal plan. The meal plans are either 7, 10, 14, and 19 'meals' a week for the duration of the semester. Each meal can be used at the cafeterias for an all you can eat style buffet, or you can trade a meal for $5.50 cash value at various places on campus. The problem with these meal plans is that every week if you do not use up your allotted meals, they will not rollover next week and you cannot trade them for cash, so they are essentially wasted. Many students end up going to one of the convenience type stores (like 711) on campus to spend all their extra meals on junk food that they may not want. 

So, the solution we came up with is creating a dining service where students who dorm can connect with eachother to order food from the cafeteria and have it delivered to them, but the only catch is that they have to pay $5.50 for the total delivery.

This essentially creates a way for students to trade their meals for $5.50 in cash.

## My Responsibilities to the Project
Having more experience in the development process, I was the team leader of the project. 

In regards to development my responsibilities were:
    - Create a webscraper to scrape the official dining menus for both the cafeterias on campus.
    - Display the data in a appropriate and user friendly way.
    - Create an edit profile page that commmunicates with the database to create an autofill feature when requesting a delivery.
    - Help design the overall frontend.
    - Looked over all Pull Requests, fixed any conflicts, and merged branches

I also contributed by creating the overall design of the frontend and backend.
