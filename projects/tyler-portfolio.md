## Summary
Designed, modeled, developed and deployed a portfolio web application for a friend to easily be able to update and maintain by himself. Decided to make this to teach myself Angular and Django Rest Framework, while improving my frontend skills.

Features included:
* Fully responsive HTML/CSS
* Customized Django Admin interface as CMS
* Contact form

## How I Built it
I created this web application using Django Rest Framework, and Angular. To create the content mangement system I created a customized django admin panel to easily add projects, and update language across the site. I deployed all of this on an AWS EC2 instance. 

Specific technologies:
* Django Rest Framework 
* Angular (4)
* Bootstrap 
* AWS EC2
