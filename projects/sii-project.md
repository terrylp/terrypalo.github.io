The Student Immunization Initiative (SII) Registered Independent Organization (RIO) asked me and a friend to upgrade their current wordpress website. Although we wanted to switch out of wordpress because of limiting capabilities, we were asked to keep using wordpress for the sake of ease of updating content on the website from a common user.

We Decided to use GitHub for our source control and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host a remote development site. We are also using Docker for a Wordpress container to continuously develop features while actively seeing feedback.
